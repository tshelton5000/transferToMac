        <h2>Two Truths, One Lie</h2>

        <h4>Birds</h4>
        <p>In one summer, two different birds pooped on me--once while mowing, once while at Disney World.</p>
        <h4>Mugged!</h4>
        <p>While walking around campus at the University of Evansville, I was mugged under a streetlight.  2 cops, 2 firemen, 2 paramedics, 2 RA's, and 2 admins from the university took care of me.</p>
        <h4>Cake Shop</h4>
        <p>During the summer between sophomore and junior years of college, I ran a cheese cake shop in Anderson and gave the proceeds to gifted innercity teens for college.</p>
